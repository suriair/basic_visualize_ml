# basic_visualize_ml
A python code for basic visualisation of .csv data file.

This code visualize the data on different types of pre-assigned Graph according to their datatype i.e

--for numeric datatype (with one column as input) it will produce histograph.

--for categorical or object datatype (with one column as input) it will produce bar graph.

--for datatime datatype with numeric datatype it will produce a datetime series graph.

--for two numeric datatype input it will produce scatter graph.


Beside producing graph it also allows the user to customize the graph with color and graph style to produce.

It also allows the user to check the mean, median, mode for a specific column.

It also displays the complete data info at the start and also allows you to crosstab the columns.


Thanks
Happy coding
